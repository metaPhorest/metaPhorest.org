Working with life can get messy. There is an ever-growing tension that forms between the desires and needs of different organisms, as well as emerging creatures and their creators. The technofication of life as a material to be grown in surplus, to manipulate, and to exploit has further complicated these relationships. In this talk, artist Lyndsey Walsh will share insights from their practice, which sets out to make space for Crip, Queer, and Intersectional Feminist perspectives to question the cultural binaries of human-non-human, diseased-healthy, and life-machine. From stem cells to cancer, GMO algae to chickens, and technoscience to magic, Lyndsey will attempt to share their approach to embracing the blood, sweat, and tears that gets shed along the way in technological pursuits to imagine new futures and redefine what it means to be alive.
