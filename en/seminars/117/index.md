## 117th metaPhorest Seminar: Haruna Nakayama & Mio Iizawa

#### This event will be primarily in Japanese, but questions and comments in English are also welcome.

On Friday, December 12th, our metaPhorest seminar will feature food designer Haruna Nakayama as our guest speaker.
During the event, we will explore the connections and intersections between “food” and “biology” while hearing about Ms. Nakayama's past activities related to food.
We will also introduce a collaborative project with ‘Zukanfu ~ Zasshi “Culture and Biology”’, planned and operated by host Mio Iizawa (metaPhorest member). We plan to discuss a project recreating recipes for “Shinagawa Meshi” (Shinagawa-style dishes) featured in the magazine, made possible with Ms. Nakayama's cooperation.
