## 113th metaPhorest Seminar by Mew Imashuku & Tomoki Matsumura

#### This event will be primarily in Japanese.

The metaPhorest seminar on Friday, November 7th will feature Miyu Imajuku, who explores relationships with people and the environment through the lens of skin sensation.
Hosted by Matsumura, a metaPhorest member and graduate of the Iwasaki Lab who develops works through performance and other mediums.


Through creating poetry, performances, and media art that approach skin sensations, Ms. Imashuku explores relationships with others and the environment.
Meanwhile, Matsumura has built new relationships through performances using motifs of non-human organisms like water fleas.
This seminar will delve into how both artists discover and engage with others/other species through their work and practice, and how their perceptions and understandings have evolved, accompanied by specific work introductions.

#### Mew Imashuku

Working across poetry, performance, and media art, Imashuku explores themes of self-integration and the reconstruction of relationships with others/the environment, using broad notions of skin sensations (heat, pressure, vibration, swaying, etc.) as a starting point.
By constructing devices and situations that shake the contours of the human body, and through practices that involve both herself and others, she attempts to open new pathways for communication.
