#### (Bio)mattering by design

This presentation traces a body of research and creative practice concerned with the material, aesthetic, and ecological entanglements of aquatic life. Through the lens of bio(mattering) — an inquiry into how matter transforms and how environments co-compose — I will discuss recent projects that work with algal organisms and other marine matter, drawing from laboratory experimentation, fieldwork, and speculative prototyping. By engaging design as both a mode of inquiry and of making, bio(mattering) proposes that a material practice can operate as a form of ecological thinking — one that situates creative production within the dynamic metabolism of Earth’s systems and planetary boundaries.
